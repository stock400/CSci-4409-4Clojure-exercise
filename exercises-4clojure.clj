;;; What you enter is what whatever you'd put in the "Code which fills in the blank"
;;; box in 4Clojure. You're welcome to include other things here (helper definitions,
;;; scratch computations you found helpful, etc.), SO MAKE SURE YOU LABEL YOUR
;;; "ANSWERS" clearly.

;;; I've included a few examples below just to give you a sense of what I'm looking

;;; Problem #162: Logical falsity and true

; What I pasted in the box:

1

; because all the given expressions returned 1, for example:

(= 1 (if [] 1 0))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

;;; Problem #15: Double Down

; What I pasted in the box:

#(* 2 %)

; which is an anonymous function that doubles its argument, for example:

(= (#(* 2 %) 11) 22)
